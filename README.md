# AllyValley

AllyValley is a Flutter application designed to help users connect with nearby individuals who are also using the app. It leverages location services to identify other users in close proximity and facilitates communication between them. This can be particularly useful for travelers who wish to meet new people and engage in conversations while on the go.

## Features

- **Location-based Matching**: AllyValley uses the device's location to identify nearby users who are online on the app.
- **Real-time Communication**: Users can initiate conversations with nearby individuals to connect and chat in real-time.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile where they can provide information about themselves, making it easier to find like-minded individuals.
- **Privacy Controls**: Users have control over their visibility and can choose to appear online or offline as per their preference.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Users can set preferences such as age range, interests, etc., to refine the matching process and find compatible connections.
- **Secure Messaging**: Conversations are encrypted to ensure user privacy and security.
